while previous sudoku grid is not equal to present grid:
    for each strategy:
        while strategy has changed a cell value:
            run the strategy

==========

for each group in the sudoku:
    for each cell, C1, in the group:
        if the number of possible values in C1 is 2:
            for each cell, C2, in the group:
                if the number of possible values is 2, and C1 is not equal to C2:
                    if the possible values in C1 and C2 are the same:
                        for each cell, C3, in the group:
                            if C3 is not equal to either C1 or C2:
                                remove all the possible values from C1 contains
                                from C3

for each row, column and box:
    for the number of cells:
        for each cell, C1:
            for each other cell, C2:
                remove the set of values from the entire row, column or box

=============

for each row, column and box:
    C = list of cells in row, column or group
    for each cell, C1, in C:
        if C1 does not have a solved digit:
            otherCells = copy of C
            remove C1 from otherCells

            arraySet = the set of possible values from otherCells
            cellSet = the set of possible values in C1 
            diff = new set

            add all values from cellSet to diff
            remove all values contained within arraySet from diff

            if the number of values in diff is 1:
                if C1 does not have a solved value:
                    value of C1 is set to the only value in diff
